# Multithread-Warehouse-Example
Just a small example of multi-threading using customer orders and workers in a warehouse as an example. Random number is assigned to how often and how many items a customer orders and workers scale to the amount of orders and work. More workers = faster packages shipped. Uses global variables and if elif statements.
